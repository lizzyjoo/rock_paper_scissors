## Introduction 
A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors, but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)

## How to play
The user may select one of the three buttons to play against computer's randomized choice. 

## Algorithm 

    1. The computer will randomly choose of of the three options: rock, paper, scissors. 
    2. User will make a choice by clicking a button of choice.
    3. Results will be determined by comparing the choices

## Things to improve
    1. Having a fixed position for the buttons and the live score div would be better. 
    2. Having some visual elements instead of just texts would make it more interesting.
    3. The code can be better organized; some repetitiveness exists in implementing the 'dynamic score update' process.
